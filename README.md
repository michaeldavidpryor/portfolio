This is bad.

I didnt finish, it's been a long week. I guess I should have asked for an extension but I just didnt.

I was laid off on Tuesday and I've just been try to get settled. I don't say this so anyone feels bad, I just want you guys to know that now I have a lot of time to dedicate to this and I'll do better.

Thanks
